# Operating-System-Algorithms
Operating system algorithms are a set of procedures and rules implemented in an operating system to manage system resources and ensure efficient and effective utilization of those resources. 

These algorithms are designed to help operating systems perform tasks such as scheduling processes, managing memory and disk space, and handling input/output operations.

Some common operating system algorithms include:

  1.  Process scheduling algorithms: These algorithms determine which process should be given access to the CPU and for how long. Examples of process scheduling algorithms include Round Robin, First-Come First-Serve, and Priority scheduling.

  2.  Memory management algorithms: These algorithms manage the allocation and deallocation of memory resources to processes. Examples of memory management algorithms include Paging, Segmentation, and Virtual Memory.

   3. Disk scheduling algorithms: These algorithms determine the order in which disk requests are processed to optimize disk access and reduce disk seek time. Examples of disk scheduling algorithms include SCAN, C-SCAN, and LOOK.

  4.  File allocation algorithms: These algorithms determine how files are stored on a disk to optimize disk space utilization and reduce fragmentation. Examples of file allocation algorithms include Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation, and Indexed Allocation.

  5  Resource allocation algorithms: These algorithms manage the allocation of shared system resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices. Examples of resource allocation algorithms include Banker's Algorithm and Deadlock Prevention algorithms.

Operating system algorithms are essential for the effective functioning of modern operating systems. By optimizing the use of system resources, these algorithms help improve system performance, reduce resource wastage, and ensure the smooth execution of user applications.
